5116,@DCWriterMom @TravelDudes Referring (as @rolfpotts) does  to finding way to make money at home to go abroad. Can WWOOF abroad for years...,3
5117,@LaurelHounslow @MalloryOnTravel Yes. Nut if not for gap year before college  I would not have excelled. Inspiration to learn and return.,3
5118,@DCWriterMom @TravelDudes Yes. Money is always an issue  but even working &lt; minimum wage on farms found time to save and go. #TTOT,3
5119,@ChristineBlogs Agree  not everyone should go to college either. Maturity takes many forms -- travel/gap year great for individuation #TTOT,3
5120,@DoonLoomden @TravelDudes Yes  Gap Year need not be age-specific. Learning/Educational travel has no age limit.,3
5121,@Claudioula @TravelDudes Some volunteer camps and volunteering are very inexpensive -- especially relative to college tuition (maybe wasted),3
5122,@SonjaSwissLife Our take. Yes! Real-life maturity developed though the Gap Year allows for maximizing educational focus &amp; new perspectives.,3
