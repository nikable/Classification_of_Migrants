@SonjaSwissLife https://t.co/GTAmbFbhKJ recommended to all without reservation of cultural immersion travel, and inexpensive. #TTOT
@SonjaSwissLife Cultural immersion travel and living endangered by the growth of "gated communities" of late. Sad, and many get rich #TTOT
@MalloryOnTravel https://t.co/ZVAdH18iDS seemed pretty sure and you would not wish to contradict them or else...
@MalloryOnTravel Arrived on Napolean's birthday. He was compared to Virgin Mary as Beethoven was played, lights, fireworks on beach... #TTOT
@MalloryOnTravel Happened to me 40 years ago in South of France and in Corsica but was more immersed in anger. üòÄüò° #TTOT
A4: Danger that "everything has been discovered." Sometimes must go off-season or look to find the rhythm of everyday cultural life. #TTOT
A4: Almost all commercial and packaged resorts away from locals. Prefer what we call "cultural immersion travel" #TTOT
A3: Restoring French watermill and French castles the way originally built while a teen in France sleeping in hay with workcamp. #TTOT
@MalloryOnTravel Yes, I agree, but a few backpackers have done much to ruin parts of Asia, so perhaps necessary.
A3: Taught Flamenco in a small town near Seville, invitations to festivals &amp; homes around the world speaking THEIR language. #TTOT
A2: Bhutan makes "Gross National Happiness" primary goal and sustainable living/travel required. #TTOT https://t.co/pa4uosCY9O

A2: Respect for locals, their culture, and their land. Study up before going and observe once there, IMHO "Golden Rule" of travel #TTOT

@DCWriterMom @TravelDudes Referring (as @rolfpotts) does, to finding way to make money at home to go abroad. Can WWOOF abroad for years...
@LaurelHounslow @MalloryOnTravel Yes. Nut if not for gap year before college, I would not have excelled. Inspiration to learn and return.
@DCWriterMom @TravelDudes Yes. Money is always an issue, but even working &lt; minimum wage on farms found time to save and go. #TTOT
@ChristineBlogs Agree, not everyone should go to college either. Maturity takes many forms -- travel/gap year great for individuation #TTOT
@DoonLoomden @TravelDudes Yes, Gap Year need not be age-specific. Learning/Educational travel has no age limit.
@Claudioula @TravelDudes Some volunteer camps and volunteering are very inexpensive -- especially relative to college tuition (maybe wasted)
@SonjaSwissLife Our take. Yes! Real-life maturity developed though the Gap Year allows for maximizing educational focus &amp; new perspectives.

@MalloryOnTravel Arrived on Napolean's birthday. He was compared to Virgin Mary as Beethoven was played, lights, fireworks on beach... #TTOT

A4: Danger that "everything has been discovered." Sometimes must go off-season or look to find the rhythm of everyday cultural life. #TTOT
A4: Almost all commercial and packaged resorts away from locals. Prefer what we call "cultural immersion travel" #TTOT

@MalloryOnTravel Wine &amp; Dionysian spontaneity, as Nietzsche would call it! Gap Years can be dreamt of from youth or in moment #TTOT
@MalloryOnTravel @DCWriterMom Yes &amp; read books at 5 &amp; dreamed of travel later then booked when could #TTOT Wanderlust like wine, imho #TTOT
@MalloryOnTravel @DCWriterMom Yes "wanderlust" is often spontaneous, often the result of reading books, etc. Dreams can start young #TTOT
@DoonLoomden @DCWriterMom @TravelDudes Canada is progressive/enlightened in so many ways, of course. #TTOT
@DCWriterMom @DoonLoomden @TravelDudes We try to explain many angles work/gap/etc. on our site which is being redesigned. #TTOT
@DoonLoomden @DCWriterMom @TravelDudes Yes, Australia, New Zealand r favorites for working holidays. Need "free trade/work agreements" #TTOT
@ChristineBlogs The later in life, often harder to justify gap year off (marriage, work, children, divorce, debt, etc.). Possible, harder.
@DCWriterMom @TravelDudes Referring (as @rolfpotts) does, to finding way to make money at home to go abroad. Can WWOOF abroad for years...
@LaurelHounslow @MalloryOnTravel Yes. Nut if not for gap year before college, I would not have excelled. Inspiration to learn and return.
@DCWriterMom @TravelDudes Yes. Money is always an issue, but even working &lt; minimum wage on farms found time to save and go. #TTOT
@ChristineBlogs Agree, not everyone should go to college either. Maturity takes many forms -- travel/gap year great for individuation #TTOT
@DoonLoomden @TravelDudes Yes, Gap Year need not be age-specific. Learning/Educational travel has no age limit.
@Claudioula @TravelDudes Some volunteer camps and volunteering are very inexpensive -- especially relative to college tuition (maybe wasted)
@SonjaSwissLife Our take. Yes! Real-life maturity developed though the Gap Year allows for maximizing educational focus &amp; new perspectives.
